Simon: Scriptable Interactive Monitoring for SDNs
=================================================

What is Simon?
--------------
We introduce SIMON, a Scriptable Interactive Monitoring system for SDN. With SIMON, operators can probe their network behavior by executing scripts for debugging, monitoring, and more. SIMON is independent of the controller platform used, and does not require annotations or intimate knowledge of the controller software being run. Operators may compose debugging scripts both offline and interactively at SIMONâ€™s debugging prompt. In the process, they can take advantage of the rich set of reactive functions SIMON provides as well as the full power of Scala.

Features
--------
1.	Interactive: SIMON exposes networking events as streams which users can explore.

2.	Scriptable: users can automate repetitive debugging tasks.

3.	Visible: SIMON exposes data-plane events, control-plane events and northbound API messages.

4.	Black-box testing: it does not assume the user is knowledgeable about intricacies of the controller being debugged.

5.	Compatible: support 1.0 - 1.3 OpenFlow messages and all the controllers. We have tested FlowLog (1.0), Ryu (1.1 and 1.3), FloodLight (1.3) and RouteFlow(Quagga, 1.3) with RFProxy.

API functions
-------------------
1.	Based functions from reactive Scala:

	*	_filter_: Applies a function to every event in the stream, keeping only events on which the function returns true.

	*	_map_: Applies a function to every event in the stream, keeping only events on which the function returns true.

	*	_subscribe_: Applies a function to every event in the stream, keeping only events on which the function returns true.

	*	_cache_: Cache can start to cache when the first subscribe happens.

	*	More: [details of observable](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) and [API of observable](http://reactivex.io/rxscala/scaladoc/index.html#rx.lang.scala.Observable)

2.	Based functions from Simon

	*	_expect_: Expect to see an event matching pred within duration d.

	*	_expectNot_: Not expect to see an event matching pred within duration d.

	*	_cpRelatedTo_: Produce related PacketIn, PacketOut, and FlowMod messages corresponding to an event.

3.	Other helper functions:

	*	_openShowEvents_: Open another xterm and print the the user observable stream.

	*	_isArpNetworkEvents_, _isDHCPNetworkEvents_, _isICMPNetworkEvents_, _isRESTNetworkEvents_, _isOFNetworkEvents_: judge whether the network event is what the user needs.


Installation
------------
To use our SDN debugger (under Ubuntu), you need:

*	Mininet: 2.10+ at: http://mininet.org/download/

*	Java 1.7+ at: https://java.com/en/download/

*	Scala 2.11.X or higher: http://www.scala-lang.org/download/

*	Controller: [__FlowLog__](https://github.com/tnelson/FlowLog) for flowlog example, [__Ryu__](https://github.com/osrg/ryu) for reactive fireware and state fireware, [__Floodlight__](https://github.com/Sherkyoung/floodlight-plus) and [__RouteFlow__](https://sites.google.com/site/routeflow/downloads) for shorest path. Note: Installing Ryu can have problems, e.g. https://github.com/okfn/piati/issues/65#issuecomment-41514608. For RouteFlow, suggest to download pre-configured VM in different VMs from our Debugger.

How to run?
-----------
1.	Compile the Monitor and Debugger:

	```
	$ cd SDNDebugger
	$ ./compile.sh
	```

2.	Run controller, one term(T1) runs controller with app.


3.	Run our debugger in the new term(T2) and wait for connection:

	```
	$ ./simon.sh
	```

4. 	Another term(T3) connects listening debugger, runs Mininet and Monitor

	```
	$ sudo ./run.sh
	```

5.	In T3, get packet and do some oracle checking now.

Examples
--------
*	State Firewall(one bug in app)

	1.	


*	Reactive Firewall

*	Shortest-Path Routing

*	Others: we can also run mininet in Scala after running mn.

	```
	./mininet/util/m h1 ping -c 1 10.0.0.2
	```

	```
	./mininet/util/m h1 ifconfig
	```

	
Limitation
----------
1.	Our monitor only supports ETH, ARP, IP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, OF_PACKET(PACKET_IN, PACKET_OUT, FLOW_MOD, ECHO_REQUEST, ECHO_REPLY)

2.	We have keep two time clock, one is depending the timestamp from jNetPcap and time in scala.	

Problems
--------
*	Q: 	Why does controller with app report some version problem?

	A: 	Make sure you use the corresponding version and do ```sudo mn -c``` to clear the running mininet.

*	Q:	Why does controller or simon report some connecting issue?

	A:	You should take care about running order (T1 -> T2 -> T3 see above).
